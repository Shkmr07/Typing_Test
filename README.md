# Terminal-Based Typing Test

## Project Description
This project is a terminal-based typing test implemented in Python. It uses Python's `random` and `time` modules to create a dynamic and interactive typing test.

## Typing Test
The typing test begins when the user selects option 1. A sentence is randomly selected and displayed to the user, who then types the sentence. The `time` module is used to calculate the time taken to type the sentence.

## Leaderboard
The leaderboard shows the top typists. It is implemented using a dictionary, with the user's name as the key and their typing speed as the value. The leaderboard can be viewed by selecting option 2.

## Options
The program provides three options to the user:
1. **Start the Typing Test**: This begins a new typing test.
2. **Show Leaderboard**: This displays the current leaderboard.
3. **Exit**: This exits the program.
